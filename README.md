I need three components:

### 1. AI building blocks.

 If all you know is how to call a large language model (LLM) API, that's a great start. But if you have a broad range of building block types — such as
 - prompting techniques,
 - agentic frameworks,
 - evals,
 - guardrails,
 - RAG,
 - voice stack,
 - async programming,
 - data extraction,
 - embeddings/vectorDBs,
 - model fine tuning,
 - graphDB usage with LLMs,
 - agentic browser/computer use,
 - MCP,
 - reasoning models,
 
 and so on — then you can create much richer combinations of building blocks.

### 2. AI-assisted coding
