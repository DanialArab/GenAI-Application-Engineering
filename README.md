# GenAI-Application-Engineering

Three main skills:

### 1. AI building blocks.

 If all you know is how to call a large language model (LLM) API, that's a great start. But if you have a broad range of building block types — such as
 - prompting techniques,
 - agentic frameworks,
 - evals,
 - guardrails,
 - RAG,
 - voice stack,
 - async programming,
 - data extraction,
 - embeddings/vectorDBs,
 - model fine tuning,
 - graphDB usage with LLMs,
 - agentic browser/computer use,
 - MCP,
 - reasoning models,
 
 and so on — then you can create much richer combinations of building blocks.

### 2. AI-assisted coding

Vibe coding is a software development trend where developers guide an AI by providing natural language prompts to generate, refine, and debug code, rather than writing it line-by-line. Coined by AI researcher Andrej Karpathy in early 2025, this AI-assisted approach focuses on collaboration and experimentation, allowing the developer to focus on the overall goal of the project while the AI handles the coding tasks. It's characterized by an iterative, conversational process, where developers provide feedback and goals to the LLM and accept AI-suggested completions to build applications.  

- Github Copilot
- AI-enabled IDEs such as Cursor and Windsurf offered much better code-QA and code generation.
- Now we have highly agentic coding assistants such as OpenAI’s Codex and Anthropic’s Claude Code (which I really enjoy using and find impressive in its ability to write code, test, and debug autonomously for many iterations).
- Warp (outperformed Claude recently)

### 3. Bonus: Product skills

I see teams move much faster if GenAI Engineers also have some user empathy as well at basic skill at designing products, so that, given only high-level guidance on what to build (“a user interface that lets users see their profiles and change their passwords”), they can make a lot of decisions themselves and build at least a prototype to iterate from.
