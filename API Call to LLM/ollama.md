- Ollama gives me an environment that gives me a full wrapper around an LLM that I can either chat with in the terminal or use as a server that I can HTTP POST to and read the output from. 

- Ollama lets me have dedicated servers inside my data centers or dedicated processes on my computer, which makes them completely private.
- Ollama, at its core, is an open-source project that simplifies the process of downloading, running, and managing LLMs on my computer. It also handles non-functional difficult requirements such as memory management and model optimization, and it provides standardized interfaces for interaction, such as the ability to HTTP POST to my models.
- By running models locally, I can ensure the complete privacy of my data, eliminating network latency, and work offline. This is especially crucial in scenarios involving sensitive data or applications that require consistent, low-latency responses.
- Each model can be pulled and run with simple commands in a way that is similar to how Docker containers work. The platform handles model quantizations automatically, optimizing models to run efficiently on consumer hardware while maintaining good performance.
- **Running Ollama as a server:**

to put Ollama into server mode, I can simply issue the following command:

      ollama server

this will run ollama server on port 11434 by default, so I can hit it and ask it to do inference with a curl command to test it:

            !curl -s http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d "{\"model\": \"gemma3:1b\", \"prompt\": \"Why is the sky blue?\", \"stream\": false}"

I got

            {"model":"gemma3:1b","created_at":"2025-09-19T21:40:09.3231831Z","response":"Okay, let's break down why the sky is blue! It all comes down to a phenomenon called **Rayleigh scattering**. Here's a simplified explanation:\n\n1. **Sunlight is Made of All Colors:** Sunlight actually looks white, but it's actually made up of all the colors of the rainbow – red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet.\n\n2. **Entering the Atmosphere:** When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it bumps into tiny particles like nitrogen and oxygen molecules.\n\n3. **Rayleigh Scattering – The Key:** This is where Rayleigh scattering comes in.  Rayleigh scattering is the scattering of electromagnetic radiation (like light) by particles of a much smaller wavelength.  It’s *much* more effective at shorter wavelengths.  \n\n4. **Blue Light is Scattered More:**  Because blue and violet light have shorter wavelengths, they're scattered much more intensely by the tiny air molecules than other colors like red and orange.\n\n5. **What We See:**  This scattered blue light spreads out across the sky, making it appear blue to our eyes.  We see this because our eyes are more sensitive to blue light than violet light.\n\n**Think of it like throwing a small ball (blue light) and a large ball (red light) at a bumpy surface. The small ball will bounce around more and scatter everywhere, while the large ball will travel in a straight line.**\n\n\n**Why Not Violet?**  Violet light is scattered even *more* than blue, but the sun emits less violet light, and our eyes are less sensitive to it.  That’s why we primarily see blue.\n\n**Bonus:**  Sunsets and sunrises are a little different! At sunset and sunrise, the sunlight has to travel through *much* more of the atmosphere. This longer path scatters most of the blue light away, leaving the longer wavelengths of orange and red to dominate, creating those beautiful colors.\n\n---\n\n**Want to learn more?

- done
- done_reason
- context
- total_duration
- load_duration
- prompt_eval_count
- prompt_eval_duration
- eval_count
