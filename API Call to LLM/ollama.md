- Ollama gives me an environment that gives me a full wrapper around an LLM that I can either chat with in the terminal or use as a server that I can HTTP POST to and read the output from. 

- Ollama lets me have dedicated servers inside my data centers or dedicated processes on my computer, which makes them completely private.
- Ollama, at its core, is an open-source project that simplifies the process of downloading, running, and managing LLMs on my computer. It also handles non-functional difficult requirements such as memory management and model optimization, and it provides standardized interfaces for interaction, such as the ability to HTTP POST to my models.
- By running models locally, I can ensure the complete privacy of my data, eliminating network latency, and work offline. This is especially crucial in scenarios involving sensitive data or applications that require consistent, low-latency responses.
- Each model can be pulled and run with simple commands in a way that is similar to how Docker containers work. The platform handles model quantizations automatically, optimizing models to run efficiently on consumer hardware while maintaining good performance.
- Running Ollama as a server:
