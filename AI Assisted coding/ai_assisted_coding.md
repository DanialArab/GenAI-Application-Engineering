Warp - ADE (Agentic Development Env.):

- I can easily clone my repo or start a new one when opening Warp
- Then I can allow Warp to index my codebase, which helps her provide me with more targeted solutions when working with my codebase - NOTE: no code is stored in Warp server
- Then I can give permission to create WARP.md based on my codebase analysis
