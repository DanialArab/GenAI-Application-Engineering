Warp - ADE (Agentic Development Env.):

- I can easily clone my repo or start a new one when opening Warp
- Then I can allow Warp to index my codebase, which helps her provide me with more targeted solutions when working with my codebase - NOTE: no code is stored in Warp server
- Then I can give permission to create WARP.md based on my codebase analysis, this can be done anytime using /init command or through answering the question being asked at the beginning 

WARP Pros:
- IDE Compatibility
- Context, Warp has a mediate context to my specific project, i can do this through indexing either at the beginning or using /index command
- Task lists and Diffs
- Prompt suggestion, I can activate it through settings -> AI -> Activate AI-> Prompt suggestion. Also, I can activate 'next command' in the settings 
- WARP has a Prompt library.
